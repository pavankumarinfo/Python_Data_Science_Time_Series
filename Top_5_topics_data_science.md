# Top 5 topics in Data science towards time series
    
  ## Python Programming Basics:
        Get familiar with Python programming as it is the most popular language for data science.
        Learn about variables, data types, loops, conditional statements, functions, and basic data structures (lists, dictionaries).
        Practice writing code to perform simple data manipulations and calculations.

  ## Pandas Library:
        Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
        Learn about the pandas DataFrame, which is especially useful for handling time-series data.
        Explore techniques for loading, cleaning, filtering, and aggregating time-series data using pandas.

  ## Time-Series Analysis:
        Understand the fundamental concepts of time-series analysis, including trends, seasonality, and stationarity.
        Explore techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, and differencing to preprocess time-series data.
        Learn about autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions for model selection.

  ## Time-Series Forecasting:
        Discover various time-series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL).
        Understand how to split data into training and testing sets and evaluate forecast accuracy.
        Practice forecasting using real-world time-series datasets and compare the results of different models.

  ## Time-Series Visualization:
        Master data visualization techniques to gain insights from time-series data.
        Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create line plots, scatter plots, and seasonal decomposition plots.
        Learn how to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in time-series data through visual exploration.

## Summary :
    As you progress through these topics, you'll build a strong foundation in data science with a focus on time-series data. 
    You can then explore more advanced topics like deep learning for time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, and working with large-scale time-series datasets.
    Practice, hands-on projects, and working with real-world data will enhance your skills and make you proficient in time-series analysis for data science.
