# Topic 1: Python Programming Basics

In this topic, we'll cover the fundamentals of Python programming. Python is a widely used, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Items covered:

  ## Variables and Data Types:
            Variables are containers used to store data in Python.
            Python supports various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
            Example:
    
            python
    
        name = "Alice"
        age = 30
        height = 1.75
        is_student = True

## Basic Operations:

        Python supports standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
        String concatenation and repetition are also possible.
        Example:
    
        python
    
        x = 10
        y = 3
        result = x + y
        print(result)  # Output: 13
    
        message = "Hello, " + name
        print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice

## Conditional Statements:

        Conditional statements allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions.
        The "if," "elif," and "else" keywords are used to control the flow of the program.
        Example:
    
        python
    
        score = 85
    
        if score >= 90:
            print("A grade")
        elif score >= 80:
            print("B grade")
        else:
            print("C grade or below")

## Loops:

        Loops allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly.
        The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or string).
        The "while" loop continues until a condition becomes False.
        Example:
    
        python
    
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4
    
        num = 1
        while num <= 5:
            print(num)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
            num += 1

## Functions:

        Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks.
        They help break down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces.
        Example:
    
        python
    
            def greet(name):
                print("Hello, " + name)
    
            greet("Bob")  # Output: Hello, Bob

## Summary:
    Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language that serves as a great starting point for learning programming concepts.
    Understanding variables, data types, basic operations, conditional statements, loops, and functions will give you a strong foundation for further exploration in the world of Python and data science.
    Practice writing code and solving problems to reinforce your knowledge.
